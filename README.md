# MAMO_content
Supplementary information for the MAMO conference poster, theres also a similar plot as those on the left but for meridional winds under "4x3_ywind_comb".
Work is currently ongoing on improving dust MMR during month 3, feel free to ask me about this at the conference or by dropping me an email.

A Rotating animated version of the central image which animates output for a Martian year can be seen [here](https://github.com/dannymcculloch/3d_Mars_gif)!
