# MAMO supplementary information
Supplementary information for the MAMO conference poster, theres also a similar plot as those on the left but for meridional winds under "4x3_ywind_comb".

***Note regarding the dust profiles for month 3:*** Work is currently ongoing on improving dust MMR during month 3, feel free to ask me about this at the conference or by dropping me an email, but in short its becoming more comparible. The poster was printed ~2 weeks ago and it has been improved over the course of the week, work is very much ongoing!

A rotating animated version of the central image which animates output for a Martian year can be seen [here](https://github.com/dannymcculloch/3d_Mars_gif)!
